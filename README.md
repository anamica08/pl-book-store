# pl-book-store
A website for the purpose of buying and/or selling old books. A very common use case, is in colleges, where students sell old books to their juniors. 

This repository should have a backend API written in JAVA and spring boot, using spring JPA as an ORM

The backend should expose a REST API, that will be consumed by the frontend.
